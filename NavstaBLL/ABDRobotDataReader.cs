///add a method for getting a channel ordinal position for a channel name

///add a method for reading entire robot file into memory

/*we're very interested in the standard channels: 
satellites
time
latitude
longitude
velocity kmh
heading
height

...so assume that you will have properties on a data model for these fields. The other channels can just be an array or list of channels. We can do this bit later - let's focus on the standard channels first.
