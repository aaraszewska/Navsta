Next steps:

1.
Create a separate unit test project called "Navsta tests". 
The new project should reference NavstaBLL
We will create unit tests that prove that the data is loaded correctly.

It should contain a reference to nUnit nuget package
Ensure that you install the Extension "nUnit 3 test adapter"
Do a little research into nunit and what it's used for.
Basically we want to run the ABDdatareader so that we can check the robot model is loaded correctly. But we must remove the dependency on the file - we will instead
pass the data in somehow (I'll show you how to do that later)


2. Ensure data only contains the required rows
Add ability to store units on robot data model.
Remove properties that aren't required for the robot model. They can be moved to the VBO model.

3. Create VBOData model class called 'VBOSample' with fixed properties for 'standard channels'. There will be a list of non-standard channel names, keys, units similar to what you've done for robotdata.

4. Add an method called "ToVBOSample" on ABDRobotData. This will provide a VBOSample for a given ABDRobotData.

5. Then we need to start thinking about how the VBOFileWriter will write the vbo file from the VBOSamples
